# Notes

## General Notes

-   In dashboard, have a choice to also include micronutrients and a choice to only use the reported values
-   Should have some kind of data validation of prices and nutrients, to not have any erroneous outliers.

## Notes about Open Food Facts entries

-   Filets de colin d'alaska 1 kg (2100/02987) (code: 3250392130091) ingredients_text also includes things that are not ingredients.
-   Ybarra olive oil (code: 8410086990607) is not complete.

## Notes about optimization

-   Would be nice to be able to also minimize certain nutrients with some sort of hyperparameter.
    For example saturated fat or carbs at the same time as price.
