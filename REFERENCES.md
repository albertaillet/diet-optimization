## Data sources

### Reference for products and prices

To get reference data on the food products that are chosen to be included, the following database can be used:

- [Open food facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/), which is a collaborative project for reference of food products.
- [Open food prices](https://prices.openfoodfacts.org/), which is an open crowdsourced database of food prices.

### Reference for food composition and micronutrients

- [The Swiss Food Composition Database](https://valeursnutritives.ch/en/)
  Data collection of the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office FSVO on the composition of foods that are available in Switzerland. The version available at the time of writing (V6.5) contains information on 1,145 foodstuffs.
- [The ANSES-CIQUAL French food composition table](https://ciqual.anses.fr/)
  The ANSES-CIQUAL food composition table gives information on the average nutritional composition of food consumed in France.
  67 components each for 100g of edible portion and an average value, a minimum and a maximum, together with a confidence code (A=very reliable, D=less reliable).
  The version available at the time of writing (version 2020) contains information on 3,185 food items.
- [Livsmedelsdatabasen, The Swedish Food Composition Database](https://livsmedelsverket.se/livsmedel-och-innehall/naringsamne/livsmedelsdatabasen),
  which contains roughly 2,400 food items. For each food item, values ​​are given for over 50 nutrients.
- [Fineli](https://fineli.fi/fineli/en/index).
  The national Food Composition Database in Finland, maintained by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare.
- [Matvaretabellen, The Norwegian Food Product Table](https://matvaretabellen.no/en/search/) is a food database that
  shows the energy and nutrient content of foods, it contains nutrient content of more than the 2.000 most commonly
  eaten foods and recipes dishes in Norway.
- [FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/), USDA’s comprehensive source of food composition data with multiple distinct data types.
- [Nutrition Coordinating Center Food & Nutrient Database](https://www.ncc.umn.edu/food-and-nutrient-database/), curated by the University of Minnesota. Very comprehensive, but not free.

Here is the combined table listing the availability of different nutrients in the three databases:

| **Average Requirement (AR)**                     | The average daily nutrient intake level estimated to meet the requirements of half of the individuals in a particular life-stage group in the general population. Used to assess adequacy of nutrient intake of groups. |
| **Recommended Intake (RI)**                      | The average daily dietary nutrient intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97.5%) individuals in a life-stage group. Used to plan diets for individuals and groups.                    |
| **Adequate Intake (AI)**                         | The recommended average daily intake level based on observed or experimentally determined estimates of nutrient intake by a group. Used when an RI cannot be determined.                                                |
| **Provisional AR**                               | The average daily nutrient intake level suggested to meet the requirements of half of the individuals in a life-stage group. An approximation of AR with larger uncertainty.                                            |

### Historic notes:

- Leonid Vitalyevich Kantorovich was a Soviet mathematician and economist, known for his theory and development of techniques for the optimal allocation of resources. He is regarded as the founder of linear programming. He was the winner of the Stalin Prize in 1949 and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1975. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kantorovich
- The [Stigler diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler_diet) is an optimization problem named for George Stigler, a 1982 Nobel laureate in economics, who posed the following problem
  - For a moderately active man weighing 154 pounds, how much of each of 77 foods should be eaten on a daily basis so that the man’s intake of nine nutrients will be at least equal to the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) suggested by the National Research Council in 1943, with the cost of the diet being minimal?:
